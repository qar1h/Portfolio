            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I’m Parth Singh, a first-year student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST). I have
                a passion for technology and am currently honing my skills in Java, HTML, and CSS. My goal is
                to become
                a web developer, where I can combine my technical knowledge with creativity to build engaging and
                user-friendly websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my tech pursuits, I’m also an acoustic fingerstyle guitarist. Music is a huge part of my
                life, and I’m excited to share my own compositions with the world soon. I believe that both coding and
                music allow for expression and creativity, and I’m eager to explore both paths.

            </p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I look forward to connecting and sharing my journey with you.</p>
